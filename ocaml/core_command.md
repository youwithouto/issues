# Core.Command

## Status: Resolved

> In the new (0.10) version, what were basic and basicâ€™ have been switched to basic_spec and basic. So you can make your old code work as it was by changing Command.basic into Command.basic_spec.

### Error

```
Error: This function has type
         summary:string ->
         ?readme:(unit -> string) ->
         (unit -> unit) Command.Spec.param -> Command.t
       It is applied to too many arguments; maybe you forgot a `;'.
```

      hash_channel (Hash.md5 ()) ic
      |> transform_string (Hexa.encode ())
      |> print_endline
    )

let spec =
  let open Command.Spec in
  empty
  +> anon ("filename" %: string)

let command =
  Command.basic
    ~summary:"Generate an MD5 hash of the input data"
    ~readme: (fun () -> "More detailed information")
    spec
    (fun filename () -> do_hash filename)

let () =
